# Function helps to merge files from different locations in their individual folders and zip
This piece of code allow you to zip folders in a location (path).

A specific use case is when you have over 30000 institutions who have reporting files of one per day and you need to copy the individual files per day on the last day of the week to the individual institution folders and then zip the folders per institution, then this solution then becomes handy.
